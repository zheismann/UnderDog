 * Rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates are two different ways of using two numbers to locate a point on a plane.

 * Rectangular coordinates are in the form (x,y), where 'x' and 'y' are the horizontal and vertical distances from the origin:

 * Polar coordinates are in the form: (r,q), where 'r' is the distance from the origin to the point, and 'q' is the angle measured from the positive 'x' axis to the point:
